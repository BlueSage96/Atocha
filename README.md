In my computer gaming course, my group created a virtual reality escape the island game. 
The setting is a tropical island chain after the player was stranded following a shipwreck caused by a giant octopus. 
The playerâ€™s goal is to avoid various dangers and escape the island by making it to an air balloon attached to a boat. 
The players use their surroundings as clues on how to progress through the game. 
For example, one of the islands have Stonehenge rocks that the player has to arrange a certain way to unlock a bridge 
to the next area.
